# Typing-Speed-Test

**Description**

Many find it time-consuming and difficult to practice and improve their typing skills. This typing speed test is a great way to start practicing and improving a person's typing skills. Personally, I used typeracer.com to practice my typing which is why a lot of the features of this program are similart to typeracer. This program includes features that improve a person's accuracy greatly and it precisely outputs the speed (Net WPM) with no sidecurves real-time!
